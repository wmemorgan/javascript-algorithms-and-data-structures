// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

    // - Confirm required data types (string, integers, floats, arrays, objects)
    // - Confirm upper/lowercase enforcement
    // - Confirm whitespace and punctuation
    // - Confirm if each argument must be the same length (strings and arrays)
    // - Confirm upper and lower bound limits of integers and floating points
